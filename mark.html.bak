			My interest in IT has been around for as long as I’ve used computers from a young age. I believe it was in primary school from prep that I first really started to use IT which began by playing some educational games, over time progressed to learning the likes of Microsoft Office and then onto using the internet itself. Back in the early 2000s schools weren’t as strict on IT usage as now which allowed me ample opportunity to learn by using without the kind of brutal restriction some have to wade through today just to open up a word processer.
			As a child I used to make mock-up websites using Microsoft Publisher, so HTML reminds me of that fondly.
			Part of my strong fascination with computers came from the fact that early on my family did not have a family computer, so I only had the chance to use them either at school or at my grandfather’s house. The internet likewise was watching my friends at their house use it or playing video games, something which I also didn’t have as early as some others.
			This pent-up deep desire to have a computer of our own to use made it that finally during mid-Primary School when my parents did buy a Family PC with Windows XP made my enthusiasm and desire grow for it, I adored that machine. 
			For a while yet we didn’t have internet until I was eleven and despite being 2007 we were given Dial-Up, we would not have ADSL until I began high school.

		<p style="background-color:lightgrey">
			In retrospect, I should have studied an IT course as soon as I left high school in 2013, but instead, I pursued originally a Bachler in Games but switched to a Bachelor in Film at SAE Melbourne. Now after a couple of years where I’m sick of spending time in retail and have a friend who works in IT, with his encouragement I’ve decided to test the waters in something I love, IT and see if I can educate myself beyond the surface level into something where I can be productive in aiding others with IT or even creating something within this ever-changing vital landscape.
			I’m not entirely sure what to expect from my studies, but I’m looking forwards to finding out as I’m sure I’m going to be challenged with some fundamentals which I just took for granted previously.

			The results from the 16 Personalities test gave me the role of <b>Mediator</b>.
			Reading their website, I found myself hard to disagree with the results, I personally do believe I fit the assigned ticket of someone who at once is both empathetic yet seeks the truth of fact beyond feelings. Someone who is eager to please, gets pleasure from helping others yet personally is quite closed off and feels out of place in the world.
In terms of playing a role within a team it means that by nature I am not a leader type, but more a support to the leader. Not just a follower, but someone actively constructive to the overall vision even if that vision was not originally my own.
I believe it means that I will do whatever I can to help my team succeed, but also willing to be critical without being aggressive. I think by nature it is a constructive support role.

	It’s hard yet to say what my ideal job in IT would be as there are so many branching fields. All I can do is what I’d rather not do, be in a call centre taking calls to help folks from the public.
 However being an IT person within a company, servicing that company and its employees is certainly something I’d be interested in doing. Learning the ins and outs of their system, helping to upgrade, maintain and work it. Learning the people at the company and trying to offer them long-term solutions instead of short term fixes.
However getting to this level would require a lot of learning, training and on-hand experience, working under someone who is knowable in the specific fields.
