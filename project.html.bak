When asked to develop a project in relation to IT many ideas spring to mind of varying scales, perhaps software to monitor moisture levels of soil to optimise the growing of vegetables or something fun like making a cool video game, or perhaps the best IT project is a challenge to this and in fact, an anti-IT project using in IT in a feasible way.
There are many moments in life when interacting with IT, or to be specific, using a phone is not ideal, rude or even dangerous. Crossing the road or watching a movie in theatres are both examples of when it is inappropriate to be allured by the screen.
Another more direct example considering the news of recent and the summer season is watching children around the water, having a phone as a distraction.
Staring at the phone is the new reading the newspaper in terms of poolside time-spending, but these things happen and it's important not to instantly assume that any parent or guardian who takes a quick glance at their device for a couple of seconds is inherently a bad parent with neglectful intentions.
Yet the by-design addictive nature of social media or engaging multimedia content can cause a lapse in time-awareness. It's not uncommon for those cooking, for example, to become distracted by the TV or using the web, the ability to lose track of time effortlessly is an innocent human trait that is universally experienced on a small scale every day.
So my idea for the IT Project is a simple one, yet effective one; create an app that sends push notifications at set intervals checking if the user is paying attention to their time or surroundings. As this is an app which the user has to download and set up, it's assumed that the user is aware that their outside concentration is important or perhaps if the app is successful then something demanded by facilities of parents to download.
The time-alert feature will be turned on and off manually not unlike a phone's alarm function and the setting of intervals of when the user is reminded can be manually adjusted.
Using the above example of the poolside, if we have a parent watching their child in the pool you won't find any official advice which states anything less than don't look away for a microsecond. However in terms of real-world reality, if we assume the environment is a stable (such as a pool) and the child is of average/above swimming level of a decent enough age (say 7/8+) then provided the parent is still within sight, too check a message on their phone for less then ten seconds then it would be a stretch to call this an act of neglect. However, it would be easy for the split-second to become longer due to the designed engaging nature of apps which might sap this time away without the user knowing.
But the only way the app is to be effective is to ensure that it's not annoying or counter-productive. It's critical therefore that it needs to be developed in a way that it only starts the timer based on screentime, as in the user actually using the phone. Otherwise, the app itself might end up pushing an endless stream of notifications even the user isn't currently using the phone and ironically could become a distraction within itself. It has to be easy to set up and not require a constant turning on and off but rather turned on once at the start of the time when the user knows they'll need vigilance and turned off at the end, so a resetting function should be developed into the app so it restarts the timer only when the phone is activated/logged in again and not while sitting on standby.
For example;

The key developmental issue of the project is rather simple, I've never made an app before and I don't know where to begin, creating a website in HTML is a new thing I'm trying to figure out so the development of an app, even a simple one would require dedication. It is also my understanding that you need Mac to make an iPhone app which is another problem as I have neither.
So the app I develop would have to be for Android (or actually Windows Phone, I do have a couple of them laying about) as I only have access to Windows or Linux OS. The prototype of the app could always run in a virtual environment on a desktop or be side-loaded using developer tools on a phone.
The app in principle sounds easy enough to develop once an understanding of how apps are developed can be established, either by programming or by using 'create-an-app' tools. A core prototype version of the app would be thus; upon activation, create a timer that pushes out notifications. It doesn't have to look or sound pretty to be working to some degree.
A core issue I believe in developing the app beyond just being a timer is understanding the Phone's OS in a way that it only sends out the notifications upon screentime usage, not the phone's clock. I imagine this might be an actual trick or trap in development for a novice beginner.
For the app to be effective in its goal it has to only work based on the assumption that the user is actually looking at the screen, not acting off a rigid timer that triggers when the phone is in the users pocket.

The project I think has merit because it's an app which while not entirely original could be spun more as a child-protector than an anti-social media app and could display information relevant to that within the app itself.
It presents a real challenge to those who have never made an app before to work towards a goal and in the process of learning how an app like this is made, could easily spring-board onto more advanced features or apps later on. If the app does work out then it could be actually developed into something that could be published on an app store which itself would be intensely satisfying.
